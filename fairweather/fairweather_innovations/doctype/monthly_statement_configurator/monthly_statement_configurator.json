This tool is designed to streamline the process of delivering monthly account statements directly to your customers' inboxes. Whether you're new to this tool or just need a quick refresher, you're in the right place.\n    </p>\n    \n    <h3>Purpose and Functionality</h3>\n    <p>\n        The Monthly Statement Configurator enables you to effortlessly manage the distribution of monthly account statements to your valued customers. By using this tool, you can conveniently select the recipients for these statements and ensure that they receive the necessary financial information in a timely manner.\n    </p>\n    \n    <h3>Getting Started</h3>\n    <p>\n        <strong>Understanding the Customer's Table</strong>: The core of this tool is the Customer's table. Anyone listed in this table will automatically receive their monthly account statements via email. The email specified in the Customer's line. It's essential to keep this table up to date to ensure accurate and consistent communication. At the moment of creation the System will do its best to get the right email address, if for some reason the email you're getting is not the right one, please feel free to change it (yes, it is editable).\n    </p>\n    \n    <p>\n        Need to send a copy to second, third email for the same customer? No problem, just add a new line with the same customer and the new email address. Each line will be treated as a separate email. So, a customer with 3 lines will receive 3 emails in three different email addresses.    \n    \n    </p>\n        \n    <p>\n        <strong>Additional Fields</strong>: While the Customer's table takes center stage, there are supplementary fields available to expedite your workflow. These fields are designed to make compiling the list of recipients as efficient as possible. They are under the Filter's section. \n        \n    </p>\n            \n    <p>\n        Let's see them one by one:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>\n            <strong>Send On</strong>: This field will allow you to choose the day of the month you want to send the statements. This is useful if you want to send the statements on a specific day of the month. For instance, if you want to send the statements on the 15th of the month, you can select the 15 in this field.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <strong>Price List</strong>: This field allows you to filter the list of customers by price list. This is useful if you want to send statements to customers who are on a specific price list.\n        </li>\n    \n        <li>\n            <strong>Customer Group</strong>: This field allows you to filter the list of customers by customer group. This is useful if you want to send statements to customers who are in a specific customer group.\n        </li>\n    \n        <li>\n            <strong>Payment Terms</strong>: This field allows you to filter the list of customers by payment terms. This is useful if you want to send statements to customers who have a specific payment term.\n        </li>\n    \n        <li>\n            <strong>Receivable Account</strong>: This field allows you to filter the list of customers by receivable account. This is useful if you want to send statements to customers who have a specific receivable account.\n        </li>\n    \n        <li>\n            <strong>Allow multiple fetches</strong>: This field is very important if you are trying to mix customers by changing to different filters. If you have this field checked, the system will fetch the customers that match the filter and will add them to the list. If you uncheck this field, the system will fetch the customers that match the filter and will replace the list with the new customers. \n            <br>For instance, let's say you want the customers that have a price list of \"Retail\" and a payment term of \"Net 30\". If you have this field checked, the system will fetch the customers that match the filter and will add them to the list. If you uncheck this field, the system will fetch the customers that match the filter and will replace the list with the new customers.\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n    \n    <h3>Adding and Removing Customers</h3>\n    <p>\n        <strong>Adding Customers</strong>: If a new customer needs to be included in the distribution list, you have the option to manually add them to the Customer's table. This ensures that they will receive their monthly statement without any delays. And also you make sure this change has a minimum impact on the Customer's table, since you don't have to go over the whole table again to verify everything is okay.\n    </p>\n        \n    <p>\n        <strong>Removing Customers</strong>: In case a customer should no longer receive monthly statements, you can easily remove them from the Customer's table. This guarantees that statements are sent only to the intended recipients.\n    </p>\n    \n    <h3>Duplicating Recipients</h3>\n    <p>\n        <strong>Should you need to send a customer's statement to multiple email addresses, the tool offers a simple solution:</strong>\n    </p>\n    \n    <p>\n        <strong>Duplicate the Entry</strong>: Create a duplicate entry for the customer in the Customer's table.\n    </p>\n    \n    <p>\n        <strong>Update Email Address</strong>: In the duplicated entry, modify the email address to reflect the additional recipient. This way, the same customer's statement will be sent to multiple email addresses.\n    </p>\n        \n    <h3>Quick Tips</h3>\n    <p>\n        Regularly Review the Customer's Table: It's advisable to periodically review the Customer's table to ensure that the list of recipients remains accurate and up to date.\n    </p>\n    \n    <p>\n        <strong>Efficient Workflow</strong>: Utilize the additional fields to streamline your workflow and expedite the process of generating the recipient list.\n    </p>\n    \n    \n    <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n    <p>\n        The Monthly Statement Configurator is a user-friendly tool designed to enhance your ability to deliver monthly account statements to your customers. By making use of the Customer's table and its associated features, you can efficiently manage recipients and provide a seamless experience for your customers.\n    </p>\n    \n    <p>\n        If you encounter any issues or have further questions, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance.
