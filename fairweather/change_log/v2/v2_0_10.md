- Introduced a new DocType called Mute Email Notifications for Customer. This DocType allows you to mute email notifications for a particular Customer. This is useful for customers who receive daily emails regarding unpaid invoices. You can mute email notifications for a particular customer for a particular period of time. 

	The way it works is that you can create a Mute Email Notifications for Customer record for a particular customer. If the customer has an unpaid invoice, the system will not send an email notification to the customer.
